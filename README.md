# Graphical user interface for cross-service label agreement score

This tool allows you to use a drag-and-drop tool for the COSLAB measurement tool [(Berg & Nelimarkka, 2023)](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24827) to label image content and assess across image recognition services and calculate the overall quality of these labels.

## Step-by-step user guide

Add images you wish to analyse either by dragging and dropping them to the user interface or through the "Add images" button.
When ready, click analyse images to move to the next step.
If you accidentally add images not meant for analysis, you can remove them through the trash icon.

On Step 2, you need to choose image recognition services used for the analysis.
For the first time you use each service, you need to provide specific details to use these application programming interfaces, entered the boxes shown when the service is selected.
The system stores this information automatically.

After clicking analyse images, the software **might become unresponsible** as data analysis is conducted.
Once ready, you are shown an overview of the results:
word clouds for labels on each service, a summary matrix showing how well services observed same themes, 1 indicating a perfect match and 0 indicating no match at all.
This is calculated using the cosine similarities per [Berg & Nelimarkka (2023)](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24827).
You can also expert the word clouds and image labelling agreements for each service.
